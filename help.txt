To run the code, simple compile the main function in Main.cpp. You can write commands in events.txt to perform different functions.

Here are a list of commands you can write in events.txt for the program to execute.

You first need to log on with either of these names:
"user" (generic user with access to all functions, used for debugging)
"manager"
"cashier"
"reshelver"
"reciever"

And then you can call any of these functions (though certain types of users can't actually run certain functions)

"sell/*itemUPC*/*(int)amount*" (simulates the action of scanning an item for sale, item will be reshelved if there's not enough items on the shelf)

"import orders" (puts any arrived orders in stock)

"reshelf items" (goes through all items in stock and shelf them, will not shelf more than the max amount allowed in store)

"reorder items" (goes through all items in stock and looks for any item below the threshold, sends an order for those items in orders.txt)

"start sale/*itemUPC*/*(double)price" (puts the item on sale at the specified price)

"end sale/*itemUPC*" (ends the item's sale)

"print store" (prints out every section, subsection and items in the store)

You need to log off at the end by writing this:
"log off"
this saves all your changes into txt files so next time you logged on the store doesn't reset.
